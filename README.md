Software Carpentry Collaboration Demo Repo
==========================================

This is a demonstration of collaboration workflows using [Git][] and [GitHub][] for Software Carpentry.

The `countries/` directory contains incomplete [Markdown][] files for each country of the world. Your task as a collaborator is to complete the information in one of the files and [make a pull request][] to the original repository with your changes.
